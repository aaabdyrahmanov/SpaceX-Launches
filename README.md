## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Nuxt.js version: 2.0.0
* Moment.js version: 2.24.0
* Vuetify version: 2.2.1
------------------

## Development Process 
> In initiation phase of this project, as much as possible, I decided to try new technologies which I didn't use before. Thus, I had faced with several challenges. For instance, the period of UI framework selection was a bit tedious. I have tried Kendo UI, AT UI and lastly I decided on using Vuetify. 

> In deployment process, I had faced with the webpack errors related to nuxt-vuetify configuration issues. For this bug, I have started to project for 3 times from scratch.

> Overall, development process was a bit challenging but much more fun for me.

## Personal Achievement
I learnt a lot during the time I spent for developing this project. They can be listed as follows:

* using moment.js on date and time related operations
* getting benefit of several UI frameworks and get familiar with their common points
* deploying the project to cloud and bring into use
* strengthened the belief on success
* an existence of solution for each problem
